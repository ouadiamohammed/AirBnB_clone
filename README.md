# AirBnB_clone

## Description

we wonâ€™t implement all the features of the AirBnb , only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months INSHAALAAH, we will have a complete web application composed by:

1- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
2- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
3- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
4- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
